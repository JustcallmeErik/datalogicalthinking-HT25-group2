# This is the git-checklist that was posted in the discord channel of this project. 

Step 0: Make sure that you have opened up the folder where your git repo is stored.

Step 1: Every time you start a coding session, go to source control in the left bar under the magnifying glass and then go to the main branch. Then click "fetch all from remote" to get the latest changes. 
Then click "Sync changes" to get the latest changes to your "local" main branch.

Step 2: After your main branch has the latest changes it is time to merge you personal branch with the main branch to that it also has the latest changes. Go to your branch in the bottom corner and then hover over "Changes". 
Click the 3 dots and expand "Branch" and then click "Merge". Then select the main branch from the menu that pops up. Then click "Sync changes". Your personal branch is now up to date with the latest changes from the main branch and you can start coding!

Step 2.5: If you forgot to sync with main before committing to your own branch or if someone else has committed something to main while you were working you first commit your changes to your branch. Then go to the main branch and get the latest changes. 
Then we merge the latest changes from main with our branch like we did in step 2 and pray there are no merge conflicts. 
Then we sync the changes. Now we are ready to do a pull request to get the changes from our branch into main

Step 3. Now we go onto the website: https://github.com/JustcallmeErik/datalogicalthinking-HT25-group2. Sometimes recent changes shows up like in the 1st pic but if it doesnt go to "Pull requests" and click "New pull request".  Make sure the base is set to main and then compare it with your branch. 
If you are able to merge click "Create pull request".
Add a message and then click "merge pull request". And you're done!

Step 4. If you can't sync your changes or there is a merge conflict in the pull request lets have a discord call and solve it together!
