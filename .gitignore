# This .gitignore is appropriate for repositories deployed to GitHub Pages and using
# a Gemfile as specified at https://github.com/github/pages-gem#conventional

# Additional Ruby/bundler ignore for when you run: bundle install

# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem 
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.
