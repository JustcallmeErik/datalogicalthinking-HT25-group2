               <p><!-- intro -->
                The Dataset consists of IMDB top 1000 movies and tv shows of all the time. 
                The original dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows">Kaggle</a>.

            Data cleaning
            The dataset was originally retrieved as a CSV file but was later converted into JSON format but the file was still not customized for the algorithmâ€™s intended purpose. All values were stored as strings at this point even though many represented numerical data. Additionally, several key-value pairs were considered irrelevant to the algorithm, including the properties   certificate, meta-score, number of votes, and gross.  
To address this, the dataset was reconstructed and modelled a way that better suited the needs of the algorithm. The model required all numerical values to be converted into either integers or floats. Furthermore, irrelevant key-value pairs were deleted from the dataset as remaining unused values would create unnecessary storage requirements. Names of properties were changed into a consistent format and longer names of keys were splitted with an underscore for increased clarity. 
After cleaning of the dataset the remaining result was a JSON file still containing the 1000 movie objects. Respective object with 11 key value pairs, consisting of standardised attributes, arrays, and nested objects within the object. The nested objects were introduced to group related data together with the aim to improve the structure and overall readability in the dataset.</p>
