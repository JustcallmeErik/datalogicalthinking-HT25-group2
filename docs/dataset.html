 <h1> Dataset</h1>
<p> The Dataset consists of the top 1000 movies on IMDB in 2020. 
The original dataset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows">Kaggle</a> and consists of 1000 rows and 16 columns. </p>
                                        
<h2>Data cleaning</h2> 
<p>The dataset was originally retrieved as a CSV file with all values as strings. The original columns of the dataset was as following: </p>
    <caption><b>Original CSV Data</b></caption>

</p>
As you can see, there were several mismatched datatypes in the original CSV. For example, Runtime_Minutes being a string instead of an int. Additionally, the Genre column could contain several values in the same column.
Additionally, several key-value pairs were considered irrelevant for the algorithm, including the properties; certificate, meta-score, number of votes, and gross. 
Since CSV doesn't support nested data, like in this case a list of genres, we decided to translate the dataset to JSON. Another benefit of translating to JSON
is the potential to connect the algorithm with an API that returns JSON files which would make it easier to get real-time upated movie recommendations.</p>

<p>The model required all numerical values to be converted into either integers or floats.
Furthermore, irrelevant key-value pairs were deleted from the dataset as remaining unused values would create unnecessary storage requirements. 
Names of properties were changed into a consistent format and longer names of keys were splitted with an underscore for increased clarity.
After cleaning of the dataset the remaining result was a JSON file still containing the 1000 movie objects. 
Respective object with 11 key value pairs, consisting of standardised attributes, arrays, and nested objects within the object. 
The nested objects were introduced to group related data together with the aim to improve the structure and overall readability in the dataset.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Some limitations to the dataset includes reliability regarding updates and potential bias within the data. 
Since we have chosen a static dataset and not connected our data too a webcrawler (to scrape IMDB), our data will not be updated when IMDBs data is.
If a movie has dropped out of the top 1000 or a new movie has been added, it would not show in our dataset, which means that our dataset will become inaccurate/outdated. 
The main purpose of our algorithm is to recommend examples of movies to watch.
Having a dataset of 1000 movies that had (some point in time) a high rating on IMDB fulfills that purpose and do not necessary need to be updated for it to gain value to the user.</p>
