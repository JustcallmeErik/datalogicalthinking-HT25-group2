            <h1>Team</h1>
            <p>Hello! We are group 2 and we hope you have enjoyed reading about the project so far. Although we had varying degrees of 
                programming experience coming into this project we all had limited experience working with pyton and no experience working
                with dataframes. Because of this we wanted to have a very inclusive development process and spent the majority of the time
                developing the algorithm and doing the data conversion in live discord calls screensharing where one person was writing and pushing the code but was getting live input from
                all participants. We also used <a href = "https://trello.com/invite/b/68f74a57dacc69782616c89b/ATTIc193b75026519523f7d7e5e767da4af5AA75245C/min-trello-tavla"> Trello</a> 
                to assign tasks and divide the work further. Furthermore, we worked exstensively with Git and developed a git-checklist to 
                ensure everyone could contribute. Below is a short description of everyones background with one major contribution they did
                to the project.</p>  
            <p>You will also find a shoutout to our precious support animals!</p>
