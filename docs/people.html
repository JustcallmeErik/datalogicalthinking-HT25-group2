            <h1>Team</h1>
            <p>Hello! We are group 2 and we hope you have enjoyed reading about the project so far. Although we had varying degrees of programming experience coming into this project we all had limited experience working with python and dataframes. 
                Because of this we wanted to have a very inclusive development process and spent the majority of the time developing the algorithm and doing the data conversion in live discord calls screensharing. 
                One person was writing and pushing the code but was getting live input from all participants. We also used <a href = "https://trello.com/invite/b/68f74a57dacc69782616c89b/ATTIc193b75026519523f7d7e5e767da4af5AA75245C/min-trello-tavla"> Trello</a> 
                to assign tasks and divide the work further. In addition, we worked extensively with Git and developed a git-checklist to ensure everyone could contribute. 
                Below is a short description of everyone's background with one major contribution they did to the project.</p>  
            <p>You will also find a shoutout to our precious support animals!</p>
